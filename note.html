      <h1>A Comprehensive Review of Protein Language Models: Architectures, Applications, and Implementation</h1>
      <p class="meta">Author: You — <time>2025-08-20</time></p>

      <section>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Protein language models (PLMs) bring the methods from natural language processing to protein sequences. This article reviews common model architectures, how they are applied to protein prediction tasks, and practical considerations for implementation.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The rise of large pre-trained models has enabled new approaches to protein representation learning. PLMs learn contextual embeddings from large corpora of protein sequences and transfer to downstream tasks such as structure prediction, function annotation, and design.

        <h2>Key architectures</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Transformer-based encoders</li>
          <li>BERT-style masked language models</li>
          <li>Autoregressive models</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Typical applications include variant effect prediction, contact prediction, remote homology detection, and generative protein design.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Implementation notes</h2>
        <p>
          For practical usage consider model size, available compute for fine-tuning, and the licensing of pre-trained checkpoints. Tools like Hugging Face and BioPython can accelerate workflows.
