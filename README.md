## Notion-style research site

This repository hosts a Notion-style website that documents my research and practical bioinformatics challenges. It contains notes, analyses, and curated resources related to ongoing projects and experiments.

If you'd like any removed files restored or prefer a different README tone (short summary, formal, or technical), tell me which and I'll update the content.

Edits made: removed site files (HTML, CSS, JS) and `requirements.txt` to clean the repository. If you prefer these moved to a separate branch or archived instead, I can do that instead.## my personal research
