## Notion-style research site

This repository hosts a Notion-style website that documents my research and practical bioinformatics challenges. It contains notes, analyses, and curated resources related to ongoing projects and experiments.

If you'd like any removed files restored or prefer a different README tone (short summary, formal, or technical), tell me which and I'll update the content.
